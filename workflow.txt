WorkHours.com 

website to have many see how many hours i spend working per day actually 
in a remote job. 

requirements 
1) timer button 
2) timer calculator 

design 
i can have both of them side by side.

creating the timer button 

the button should have two states 
1) on state  it displays start
2) off state it display stop 

we can take care of it using variable or something , right.. 

intially when the page loads button is at start 
and on each click, it would change it's position 



so the div with class heading is the heading div 
which should display the center heading of the page. 

now below this div , we have two divs 

one div containing button let's say div1

one  div with timer class let's say div2

now these div1 and div2 must come in parallel after some spacing from the heading 
div .. 
so make these changes and everything should have proper margin and padding.
